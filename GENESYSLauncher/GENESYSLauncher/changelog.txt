v2.0:
- Redid the settings system to use Visual Studio's setting system.
- Rewrote the code behind the scenes for better efficency.
- The launcher will now detect which of the 3 games you have installed, and will remove necessary entries in the list.
- You can now view information about a game by pressing the "GAME INFORMATION" button.
- Added Discord integration. (WIP)
	- As a result, you can only hide the launcher upon loading a game.

TODO: complete discord integration
